# Diffusion-Models-for-Fast-Detector-Simulation

To accomplish this task, will implement a Diffusion Network model to represent the events in task 1 using the provided dataset of Quark/Gluon jet events. Will show a side-by-side comparison of the original and reconstructed events and use an appropriate evaluation metric to estimate the difference between the two.

steps to implement it:

Data Loading: Load the dataset of Quark/Gluon jet events.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.

Model Definition: Define the architecture of the Diffusion Network model.

Training: Train the Diffusion Network model on the dataset.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model by reconstructing the events and calculating an appropriate evaluation metric.

Visualization: Visualize the side-by-side comparison of the original and reconstructed events.
